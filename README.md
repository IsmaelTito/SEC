# Requirements

- animalai 1.1.1 
- animalai-train 1.1.1
- stable-baselines3 1.7.0
- tensorflow 1.14.0
- keras 2.2.5
- h5py 2.10

# Simulation environment

To run the simulations, the creation of a conda environment is recommended. Proceed by following these instructions:

1. Select the model you want to run, and edit its parameters on the corresponding script: 

	- For SEC: run_agent_sec.py
	- For DQN: run_agent_dqn.py
	- For MFEC: run_agent_mfec.py
	- For ERLAM: run_agent_sec.py

2. Once you have selected the number of experiments and model parameters, run the script.

3. The data from the experiments will be stored in /data/simulations.

4. Use the notebook files in /notebooks for analyze the data and plot the figures.
